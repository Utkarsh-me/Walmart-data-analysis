## Project Workflow
1. **Data Cleaning (Python)**
   - Removed noise and irrelevant data.
   - Handled missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies using Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy.

2. **Data Storage (MySQL)**
   - Connected the Python source file to a MySQL server.
   - Pushed the cleaned data into MySQL tables for structured storage and analysis.

3. **Data Analysis (SQL)**
   - Utilized SQL queries to answer complex business questions and perform in-depth analysis.
   - Examples of queries include:
     - Identifying top-performing stores.
     - Analyzing seasonal trends in sales.
     - Finding correlations between different variables like product categories and customer demographics.

4. **Data Visualization (Power BI)**
   - Exported processed data from MySQL to Power BI.
   - Built an attractive and interactive dashboard to display key metrics and trends.
   - Enabled stakeholders to explore insights through visual storytelling and interactive features.
